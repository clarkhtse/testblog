            > The classList object, added to all nodes within the DOM, provides developers methods by which to add, remove, and toggle CSS classes on a node.  classList also allows developers to check if a CSS class has been assigned to a given node.

            A very awesome HTML5 API. Finally, a native way to add, remove, and toggle classes. Looks like only Firefox and Chrome currently support it. Discovered within this [promising commit to jQuery by Dominic Barnes](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/228) via [Louie Remi Babe](https://twitter.com/louis_remi/status/36106458009444352).
