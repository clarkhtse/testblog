  TotalFinder is little app that adds a couple much-needed features to OS X's file browser, namely tabs and split windows. Finder windows tend to multiply as the day goes by. Having all Finder windows collected removes a lot of desktop clutter.

  There are other Finder replacement apps out there, but this is the only one I've stuck with. It works as an extension to Finder, rather than a completely separate app. So I don't have to re-learn the <i>Go to Folder</i> key command. The Visor feature could be nice, but I've found it a bit buggy and unresponsive.
