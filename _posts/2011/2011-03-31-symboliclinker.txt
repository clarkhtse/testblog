name: SymbolicLinker - Contextual menu creates symbolic links in Finder
type: link
tags: OS X
generator: Tumblr Gem

layout: default

description:  Yeah, I can create symlinks in Terminal, but after using it one time, I'm loving being able to use a GUI for symlinking. Creating, dragging, and dropping keeps it simple stupid for me and I don't have to remember the syntax or filepaths.
