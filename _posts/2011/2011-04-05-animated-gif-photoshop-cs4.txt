  >
  > 1. Go to open, select your GIF, then in the bottom left corner of the open file dialogue box select Quicktime Movie as the format, then open your GIF.
  >
  > 2. You’ll need to open your animations window by going to window -> animation. This will bring up the time line.
  >
  > 3. If you want to have all of the frames broken up into layers, click the options in the animation window, and select “Flatten Frames into Layers”.
  >
  > This will give you access to all the frames as layers and you can now edit the GIF as though it was a movie.
