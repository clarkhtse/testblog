          > There are four slightly different syntaxes that may be used for attributes in HTML: empty, unquoted, single-quoted and double-quoted.

          This can be useful for escaping quotes in attributes, as seen in this example from the [recent jQuery 1.4.3 release notes](http://blog.jquery.com/2010/10/16/jquery-143-released/):

              <div data-options='{"name":"John"}'></div>
