        There is no flat perfect star shape in Photoshop, nor is there one in Illustrator.  Unbelievable.

        Next time you need to make a perfect 5 pointed star in Illustrator use 100px and 38.2px.  500px and 191px works as well (alas 191 is a prime!).

        I know this 'cause I just spent 30 minutes doing the trig.
