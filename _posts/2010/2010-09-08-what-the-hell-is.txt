            > Hey Mr Listener… that’s just a lil’ trick: the `~` is JavaScript’s bitwise NOT operator. Applying it twice (NOT NOT) is just a cheeky way of doing a `Math.floor` for positive numbers. But it’s waaaay faster than `Math.floor` (and just slightly faster than `<<0`) – which is important if you are trying to update 300 particles every frame ;)
