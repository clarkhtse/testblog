            > If you prefer, you can set these options via the commmand line (instead of editing the config file) like so: 
            >
            >     $ git config branch.master.remote origin 
            >     $ git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
            >
            >Or, if you're like me, and want this to be the default across all of your projects, including those you might work on in the future, then add it as a global config setting: 
            >
            >     $ git config --global branch.master.remote origin 
            >     $ git config --global branch.master.merge refs/heads/master

            I'm trying out the global option as I never remember how to do this.
